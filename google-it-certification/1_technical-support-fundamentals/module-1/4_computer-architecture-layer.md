# [Computer Architecture Layout] - [2025-07-29]

**A computer can be divided into four main layers:**

- Hardware
- Operating System
- Software
- User Interface

We move from the most technical, low-level part of the machine (hardware and components) to the most accessible part (user interface).

### Notions

**Abstraction:** The process of taking a relatively complex system and simplifying it for our use.

**Hardware layer:** Consists of the physical components of a computer.

**Operating system:** Allows hardware to communicate with the rest of the system.

**Software layer:** The programs and applications that allow us, as humans, to interact with the computer.

**User:** The person who interacts with the computer.
