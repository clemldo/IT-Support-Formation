# [Computer Architecture Layout] - [ 2025-07-29 ]

**Computer can be cut into four main layers:**

- Hardware
- Operating System
- Software
- User interface

We go from the most technical, low-level of the machine (hardware and components) into the most accessible part (user interface).

### Notions

**Abstraction:** To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.

**Hardware layer:** Made up the physical components of a computer.

**Operating system:** Allows hardware to communicate with the system.

**Software layer:** How we as humans interact with our computer

**User:** Interacts with the computer
