### Calculation

- The <u>Abacus</u> was used to count large numbers

-  Looms of <u>Joseph Jacquard</u> used **binary system** and **programming** with punch cards

- One of the first mechanical calculators, also called **analytical engine** was develop by <u>Charles Babbage</u> introducing **automation** in calculation

- <u>Ada Lovelace</u> is recognize for writing the first **algorithm** for Babbage's analytical Engine.

### Stages of Computer Evolution

In 1950 **punch cards** were a popular way to store data, then be replace by **magnetic tape**.
Analytical engines was huge and works with **vacuum tubes**.

**ENIAC** was the first programmable general-purpose computer.

<u>Admiral Grace Hopper</u> were a computer scientist that invented the very first **compiler**

The <u>Xerox Alto </u>, considered one of the first workstations or personal computer, it had multiples aspect of a modern computer including a **GUI (graphical user interface),** a mouse, Ethernet networking and **multi-processing**.

### Age of computing and Operating System

In 1970, <u>Steve Woziak</u> invented the **Apple 1**, a computer meant for hobbyists, and with his friend <u>Steve Jobs</u>, they created a company called <u>Apple Computer</u>.


In the 1980's, <u>IBM</u> introduced its personal computer, release with an primitive version of an **operating system** called **MS DOS** (Microsoft Disk Operating System)

**Unix** was an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but it wasn't <u>cheap and available.</u>

<u>Richard Stallman</u> developed a free Unix-like OS ; **GNU (_GNU's not Unix!_)** with similar functionality to **Unix** but write by an **open source** code. But it didn't evolve into a full OS.

And then arrived **Linux**, created by <u>Linus Torvalds</u>.

In the 1990's, **PDAs (personal digital assistants)**
allow computing to go mobile, all-in-one handy handheld device.

In the late 1990's, begin age of **smartphone**.

### Pioneers in Computing


<u>Ada Lovelace</u>

She published a set of notes which contained the first computer algorithm for the Analytical Engine in 1843.


<u>Alan Turing</u>

He developed the concept of the Turing machine, he define computation and its limitations.


<u>Margaret Hamilton</u>

She developed software for predicting weather. She also work on a software that used in the NASA Apollo command and lunar modules. She literally define the term of "software engineering".


<u>Admiral Grace Hopper</u>

She worked on the programming team for the Mark I

### NOTIONS:

**Binary system:** A system of encoding information using only two possible values, typically represented as 0 and 1, often corresponding to off and on states.

**Algorithm:** A defined sequence of steps designed to perform a task or solve a problem.

**Cryptography:** The art of writing and solving codes

**Data processing:** Any process that uses a program to enter data and summarize, analyze or otherwise convert data into usable information

**Compiler:** A process to translate human language via a programming language into a machine code

**Graphical user interface (GUI):** A visual environment which help user to navigate into a computer.

**Operating System (OS):** A system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

**Open Source:** A code that anyone could modify and share.
