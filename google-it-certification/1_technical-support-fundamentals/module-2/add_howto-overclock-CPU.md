# How to overclock a CPU safely

As an IT Support professional, you may be asked to overclock a CPU. There are steps you should follow to do this as safely as possible. Always make sure that the requestor understands the risks of overclocking before agreeing to perform this procedure.

### 1 Check if overclocking is supported

First, make sure the CPU is a model that is unlocked for overclocking. Not all CPUs can support overclocking, including most laptop CPUs. Check the CPU manufacturer.

### 2 Clean the inside of the computer:

Turn off and unplug the computer. While wearing an anti-static wristband, open the computer and use compressed air to remove any dust build-up that has accumulated. It is especially important to remove any dust from around the CPU, fans, and intake vents.

### 3 Ensure an appropriate CPU cooler is installed (critical):

 If the computer has a stock CPU cooler, it is most likely insufficient for cooling an overclocked CPU. Replace the stock CPU cooler with an advanced cooling system, like a liquid cooling system.


### 4 Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for overclocking the CPU:

1. Use benchmarking software to establish a baseline for the normal performance of the computer.

2. Set each CPU core multiplier to the value of the lowest multiplier using either the manufacturer’s overclocking software (recommended) or the BIOS. Then reboot the computer.

3. Increase each CPU core multiplier by 1 to increase the CPU frequency.

4. Test each increase for stability using the testing utility provided by the manufacturer.

- Fix any problems flagged by the testing tools, especially temperature alerts. If the system becomes too unstable, roll back to the last frequency that produced a stable performance and stop overclocking the CPU.

- If the voltage appears to become insufficient to support the new frequency, increase the voltage by 0.05V. Do not increase the voltage above 1.4V without specialized cooling hardware.

- If the computer freezes or crashes, it has either become completely unstable or the CPU is not getting enough voltage to support the overclocked frequency. Use the BIOS to return to the last stable frequency or increase the voltage in 0.01V increments until stable.

5. If stable, reboot the computer before attempting the next increase.
